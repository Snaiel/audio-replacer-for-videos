# audio-replacer-for-videos
script for applying polished audio to a video file

used when you've edited the audio of a video (for ex. Audition) and want to apply save it to the video without using Premiere Pro to encode it (which takes a very long time compared to this way)

When applying an .mp3 of the audio, the overall video would be smaller than if i used Premiere Pro and Handbrake, and it took less time and clicks

## usage
* make sure the original video and the edited audio is in the media sub directory
* run   main.py
* it will prompt you for the video, audio, and name of final video
* it also asks if you want to process another video
